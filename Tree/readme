This implementation of a binary tree can be demonstrated through a game in the style of "20 Questions". The game begins with the Tree.game() function.

To use, put all files in the same directory and run "Runner.java"

The game begins with one final guess, is it a seamonkey. After each failed final guess, the user is prompted to give the true answer and one unique property.
After each round, a new game starts with the new info added to the tree.

Example text from console, program output in quotes:
"sea monkey?"
no
"what is your thing"
horse
"what is one unique property"
lives on land
"thanks for the info, new game startin"
"lives on land?"
yes
"horse?"
yes
"I win the game, would you like to restart?"
nah
"byebye"
