# 2014-15-CS-Assignments
My personal backup of finished SE CompSci Assignments. All code is exactly the same as when turned in. The only addition are the readme files. 

My documentation was not very good when I began programming. Some of the readmes are crucial. Sorry, me.  

Note: If you are a current SE student, then congratulations! Feel free to use my work as you see fit, but please use it responsibly.
Cheers
